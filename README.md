# React Anecdotes Project

Go to https://drewcsontos.github.io/ReactAnecdotes/index.html to check out my React project.

This was the first project I made in React. It lets you vote on different anecdotes and also displays random anecdotes. I didn't style it at all with css since I was focusing on learning React. 

Made as an exercise from the course https://fullstackopen.com/en/.
